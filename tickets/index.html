      <h2>Tickets</h2>
      <p>
        Ticket sales will start on <strong>Wednesday, June 26, at 4pm</strong>
        on this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to fit everybody's means, the price for the tickets is
        basically <b>pay what you want</b>. On the one hand, if you are a
        student, unemployed, or similar we don't want the ticket price from
        keeping you to attend, and on the other hand, if you earn decent money and
        want to support the Rails community, we want to provide you with a simple
        way to offer a little bit of extra support.
      </p>
      <p>
        For regular participants <b>we suggest a ticket price of at least
        25€</b>. If you lack the money just pay less, and if you can afford it,
        why not chip in 50€ for an even better camp? It should be noted
        that this is a strictly non-profit event, so all your money goes into
        the event, and if there's any surplus, it will go to the Ruby Berlin
        e.V. to further support the Ruby/Rails community. (For example the e.V.
        wants to buy networking hardware, that could then be borrowed for free
        for any Ruby event in Germany.)

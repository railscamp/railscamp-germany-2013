  <h2>Contribute</h2>
  <p>RailsCamp Germany is a non-profit event <strong>by the community, for
  the community</strong>. Therefore, it is essential that everybody contributes
  to making it a great event.</p>
  <h3>Help with event organization</h3>
  <p>
    As a decentralized organization team, we’ve set up some tools to help us
    collaborate remotely. If you want to get get involved before the event, check
    out what we already have, find something you’d like to help with or add
    something new, and join the conversation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues?state=open">GitHub Issues</a> on the event repo are our main organization channel. Just pick an issue that you want to help with, create issues that are missing, or provide helpful information on existing issues.</li>
    <li><a href="irc://irc.freenode.net:7000/railcamp_de">#railscamp_de</a> on Freenode is our offical IRC channel. Just drop by anytime.</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/railscamp2013">orga mailing list</a> is the only non-public channel, which we only use for confidential information. If you want access, just request it. It’s not necessary for anything other than looking at a few boring numbers, though. ;)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We’re also doing regular Google Hangouts every Tuesday at 5pm. The URL is
  always shared on both IRC and Twitter.</p>
  <h3>Organize a session</h3>
  <p>
    RailsCamp is organized like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a>,
    so the content of the sessions depends on you, the participant. Sessions
    can be talks, discussions or workshops related to Ruby, Rails, JavaScript,
    and other software development topics, but also anything else that you're
    excited about. Seriously, <em>anything</em> goes!
  </p>
  <p>Sessions could look like these for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My awesome new gem</li>
    <li>This cool new feature in Rails 4</li>
    <li>Bike repairing 101</li>
    <li>Anonymous Coffee Nerd Support Group</li>
    <li>Ultimate Frisbee game</li>
    <li>How to give up your apartment and become a modern nomad</li>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>So, get going and start thinking about your own session!</strong></p>

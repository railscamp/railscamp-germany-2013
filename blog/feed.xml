      <title>Needs moar Internet</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a quick update on the Internet connection at the venue. Maybe we could use your help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='the_problem'&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venue itself only has a tiny 2 Mb/s DSL connection that won&amp;#8217;t help us much and our efforts to get partners for a decent and affordable or sponsored alternative have not succeeded so far. We&amp;#8217;ve had contact with NetCologne, T-Mobile and Vodafone, but we couldn&amp;#8217;t reach the right people there for our type of event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='the_current_solutions'&gt;The current solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a service provider that will provide us with hardware to bundle multiple LTE and other Internet sources. However, in addition to the rental costs for the hardware, we&amp;#8217;d need to pay ~8.50€ per GB for LTE data beyond an allowance of 50GB, which might exceed our budget rather quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re also looking at the option of a directional wi-fi connection from somewhere with a better uplink, but it&amp;#8217;s not easy to get access to a tall building within sight of the venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='can_you_help'&gt;Can you help?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any contacts at one of the big LTE/UMTS providers in Germany and could help RailsCamp get sponsored SIM cards for the weekend, or a proper discount on traffic costs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know somebody with access to a taller building in Köln Kalk to place a directional antenna?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any other idea how to get decent, affordable Internet to a remote urban location?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details are available &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/34'&gt;on the according GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;, which is also the best way for you to contribute. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Second batch of tickets now on sale!</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='SELL ALL THE TICKETS' src='http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/39726054.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first batch of tickets is almost gone, we just added another 100 tickets! &lt;sup id='fnref:1'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already have a ticket, go out and spread the word to all Ruby, Rails, and Web people you know! If you were thinking about attending, but haven&amp;#8217;t decided yet, you should probably &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='/tickets'&gt;get yours now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, because it might be too late otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, we&amp;#8217;re all incredibly excited about RailsCamp Germany this year, and the crowdsourced organization &lt;a href='/news/2013/07/11/getting-warmer.html'&gt;is going really well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for news about our session planning tool, which you can use to announce your session, so that other people can express their interest in it. That way we can easier allocate the room/location and time for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you all in Cologne in 2 weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='footnotes'&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id='fn:1'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also added the option to pay in cash at the door for people who don&amp;#8217;t own a credit card. Please only use it in that case. Furthermore, it is now possible to buy 2 tickets at once, which many people wanted to do already, but couldn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting warmer</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not even 3 weeks left until the best RailsCamp ever – time to start warming up and announcing things! But first off, a big thank you to everybody who already contributed something, anything, to this unconference extraordinaire! You&amp;#8217;re many, and it&amp;#8217;s going great so far. Keep it up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s begin with a short (obviously incomplete) summary of the current state of organization. Please dive in and help out with anything you like&lt;sup id='fnref:1'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, even if it&amp;#8217;s just adding useful information to the comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll have a &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/27'&gt;beer garden&lt;/a&gt; and a large &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/16'&gt;hack tent&lt;/a&gt; with beach chairs n stuff outside, and we can officially make noise there until 5am. The &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/36'&gt;warm-up party&lt;/a&gt; will also take place there, so if you want, you seriously don&amp;#8217;t have to leave the venue at all from Friday until Sunday.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The setup indoors &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/21'&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/29'&gt;pretty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/23'&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/13'&gt;sorted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/3'&gt;out&lt;/a&gt;, and fortunately most of the material doesn&amp;#8217;t even have to be shipped there, because the venue comes with all sorts of things like chairs, stage elements, etc.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/28'&gt;We still need some projectors&lt;/a&gt; (or how the Germans among us like to call them: beamers). If you can bring one, please add a comment to the issue!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s going to be a &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/14'&gt;Railscamp 5k Run&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll have &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/9'&gt;über-awesome wi-fi&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of the CCC&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#8217;re still trying to get a proper &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/34'&gt;Internet uplink&lt;/a&gt; secured. Hope for the best, or help get it done!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Our campers and Sailor sponsors of &lt;a href='http://geekstammtisch.de/'&gt;Geekstammtisch&lt;/a&gt; will &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/37'&gt;set up their podcasting studio&lt;/a&gt; at the venue, and will probably even do live recording sessions if you&amp;#8217;re interested. Furthermore, we&amp;#8217;ll have a freelance journalist &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/15'&gt;creating a short movie&lt;/a&gt; about the camp.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/8'&gt;Ticket sales&lt;/a&gt; are going well so far (more on that in the next post), and most of the first batch is gone. Fun fact: at the time of this writing, you contributed the average amount of 7 EUR more per ticket than the suggested price. Thank you, everybody!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We have a quote for a &lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/17'&gt;coffee truck&lt;/a&gt; (with flat rate and optional crêpe unit), but we still need sponsors for it (~500/day). Anyone interested in making &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of campers &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; happy?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/30'&gt;Rails Girls&lt;/a&gt; will be officially part of the camp with sessions, app hacking, and more. Separate announcement/invitation coming up. Thanks to everybody involved in this so far!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it for today&amp;#8217;s status update. As you can see, we&amp;#8217;re unstoppable by now, and it&amp;#8217;s only getting even better by the day. &lt;strong&gt;Thanks again to everybody who contributed so far!&lt;/strong&gt; And see you tomorrow for our next announcement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: We also have &lt;a href='/blog/feed.xml'&gt;an Atom feed for the blog&lt;/a&gt; now. Use any RSS/Atom reader to subscribe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='footnotes'&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id='fn:1'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8221; always includes you and every other participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>RailsCamp Germany is back, and you're all invited!</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve probably heard it on Twitter already, but this is where shit gets real: RailsCamp Germany is back, and it&amp;#8217;s going to be &lt;em&gt;[fill in favorite neologism or TV show quote for the highest level of awesomeness]&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;ll be happening during the weekend of July 27/28, with our traditional warm-up party the night before, of course. Fortunately, we found an incredible venue in Cologne, accommodating about 200 humans, and allowing all sorts of activities and spontaneous RailsCamp craziness to happen. If you want, you can even set up tent in the the neighboring skate hall, so you don&amp;#8217;t have to leave during the whole weekend. And how about a climb up the walls during the day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='Venue, Main Hall' src='/img/venue_main-hall_1.png' /&gt; &lt;img alt='Venue, Main Hall' src='/img/venue_main-hall_2.png' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, RailsCamp Germany is still all about networking and exchanging knowledge and ideas in the most laid-back atmosphere possible – no stress, no hardcore schedule, lots of fun, and space for whatever you feel like doing. And most importantly: &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; will decide what exactly the camp will be in the end! In fact, we have only 2 rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everybody contributes, no matter what or how small. &lt;sup id='fnref:1'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There are no other rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this 5th edition of RCG more than doubling the size of the event once again, it&amp;#8217;ll take some more hands and planning to stay on top of our customary anarchy. And as a 100% non-profit community event we&amp;#8217;ll need as many of you as possible to help get everything in place for this Unconference Extraordinaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a decentralized organization team, we&amp;#8217;ve set up some tools to help us collaborate remotely. If you want to get get involved before the event, check out what we already have, find something you&amp;#8217;d like to help with or add something new, and join the conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues?state=open'&gt;GitHub Issues on the event repo&lt;/a&gt; are our main organization channel. We started adding some topics and tasks a week ago, but people are adding new things every day.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='http://titanpad.com/BUX3ZVllLt'&gt;The original idea pad&lt;/a&gt; still contains some things, that are not yet converted to GitHub issues. Furthermore, specific pads are linked at the bottom. Feel free to add and edit anytime.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='irc://irc.freenode.net:7000/railcamp_de'&gt;#railscamp_de on Freenode&lt;/a&gt; is our offical IRC channel. Just drop by anytime.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/railscamp2013'&gt;The orga mailing list&lt;/a&gt; is the only non-public channel, which we only use for confidential information. If you want access, just request it. It&amp;#8217;s not necessary for anything other than looking at a few boring numbers, though. ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re also doing regular Google Hangouts every Tuesday at 5pm. The URL is always shared on both IRC and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For session planning before and during the event, we will have a nice little Rails app, developed by the fine folks of &lt;a href='http://2013.eurucamp.org/'&gt;eurucamp&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#8217;ll be able to add whatever you want to start – talks, discussions, activities, workshops, etc. – and people can then register their interest, so we can decide on the room/location details on site, depending on how much space is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the increased costs, and that we cannot afford too much uncertainty on no-shows, this year we will have entry fees for the first time ever. We&amp;#8217;ll have 3 types of tickets – students, normal, and supporters – with the normal one costing around 25 EUR. That&amp;#8217;s still a killer deal for a 2.5-day developer paradise, and that&amp;#8217;s mostly due to our awesome&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sponsors! We haven&amp;#8217;t compiled the various packages yet, but if you&amp;#8217;re running or working at a company which could chip in a few bucks (or many), please get in touch! We&amp;#8217;ll have sponsoring opportunities starting at a few hundred Euro, so there&amp;#8217;ll be something for every budget. And if you&amp;#8217;re on the lookout for new developers to hire, we have some nice extras planned for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, long story short: fellow RailsCampers, you&amp;#8217;re all invited to join us for the 5th incarnation of RailsCamp Germany in about 2 months in Cologne!&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#8217;re open to everyone, from beginners to masters of their craft. It&amp;#8217;ll be an epic weekend of learning new things, meeting fellow enthusiasts, and having tons of fun. Everything is allowed&lt;sup id='fnref:2'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and you&amp;#8217;re in charge of the program. We&amp;#8217;re incredibly excited, and we hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested, then mark your calendar, follow us &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/railscamp_de'&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and track the event &lt;a href='http://lanyrd.com/2013/rcg13/'&gt;on Lanyrd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one more thing: In order to keep the books clean and pool more resources within the German Ruby community, we&amp;#8217;re glad to announce that the &lt;a href='http://rubyberlin.org'&gt;Ruby Berlin e.V.&lt;/a&gt; will be the official host of this year&amp;#8217;s camp! They&amp;#8217;re an amazing bunch of committed volunteers&lt;sup id='fnref:3'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and we&amp;#8217;re very happy to have them on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='footnotes'&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id='fn:1'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a talk, a discussion session, asking questions, helping out with one of the many tasks on site (e.g. manning the reception stand for an hour), helping organize something upfront – whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:2'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except being racist, sexist, or any other kind of mean, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:3'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/railscamp_de/status/339386679498530817'&gt;check this out&lt;/a&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href='#fnref:3' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
